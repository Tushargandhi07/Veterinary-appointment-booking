## Veterinary Appointment Booking System

A project that enables pet owners to schedule appointments with veterinarians at a veterinary clinic. The backend will handle pet and owner data, vet availability, and scheduling. The application can use Redis as a queue service to manage appointment requests and notifications. For system design, students can implement a microservices architecture to improve scalability and reliability.
